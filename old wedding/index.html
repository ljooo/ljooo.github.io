	<h3> getting there </h3>
	</div>
	<p> if you're coming from the northeast, your best bet is to drive. if you don't have a car, you should probably rent one. zip car has some pretty good weekend rates. and, if you need a travel buddy, let us know, and we will try to help you find one! it is a little over two hours from booklyn. <p/>
	<p> if you're flying in, you should fly to JFK, LGA, Newark, or Albany. you'll need to rent a car from any of those places.</p>
	<p> if you don't want to drive, there is an Amtrak station in Rhinecliff, NY. It's about 20 - 25 minutes from clermont, and tickets should be roughly $55 roundtrip. There should be taxis waiting outside the station or you can call ahead and arrange a pick up.  The local taxi service number is (845) 750-TAXI (8294).</p>
