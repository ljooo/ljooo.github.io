<ul>
<li>how to make a list</li>
</ul>

<p>how to write in paragraphs and maybe sentences. how to make letters small and large and slanted and straight.</p>

<p>Here is the story. i am finally taking a class! when i first started working at GA, i went through all the circuits, but i couldn't really learn as much as i needed to. sarah and i would sit together and she'd show me some tricks and i liked the way that writing code was kind of like art. i had dreams of making our wedding website, but it was so much easier for sarah to make it interesting, so she just did it. and then i never really learned.</p>

<h5>but look now how everything is italicized. i think i have to make classes and ids to separate the paragraphs.</h5>

<p>image is way too big.</p>
