I am interested in the way that memories are stored in gmail. I'd like to create a an experience based on the user's perception of these memories. ("everyhing and nothing")

final project ideas (if I can use gmail's API):

1. I am thinking I could have a search box where you'd enter a date (i.e. 1/20/2012) and the program would pull up one email from that date (or the closest one to it). it would scan the email and spit out the most frequently used word (i.e. "confused"). Then, there would be a visual component that would map your output emotions along a timeline.

2. A search box where you enter a single word into a search box. That word is used to search your gmail inbox, spotify, and some visual database. this creates an experience. 

3. A "keep forever" chrome extension to which you can save anything important (a song, a picture, an email) 

4. something with the meta data of photos. like using the date from a picture to bring up an email, or something.
