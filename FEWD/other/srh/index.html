    <span class="two"> this is honestly the best thing we've ever done. <br> [you remember.] <br> go to your internal place. listen to music. take take for your brain <br> [it was not that long ago we sat near each other and maybe we <br> dressed similarly or liked the same things <br> and maybe we talked about books we loved or how to make art. <br> maybe it was sunny out and we craned our necks out the window <br> or walked around the park with our legs out.] <br> i don't know what i'm supposed to feel. <br> it is really sad to check these off because they dissapear. <br> [we won't forget]  <

    <span class="three">at some point, though, we became sisters. <br> we drove through california with the windows down. we made art <br> with pillows and pool noodles. we ate well and rested. <br>at some point, you found out i was toothless <br> and in love. </span></br>
