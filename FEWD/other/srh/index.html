    <span class="one">not that long ago </span></br>
    <span class="two"> you remember. <br> we sat near each other and maybe we <br> dressed similarly or liked the same things <br> and maybe we talked about books we loved or how to make art. <br> maybe it was sunny out and we craned our necks out the window <br> or walked around the park with our legs out. </span></br>
    <span class="three">at some point, though, we became sisters. <br> we drove through california with the windows down. we made art <br> with pillows and pool noodles. we ate well and rested. <br>at some point, you found out i was toothless <br> and in love. </span></br>
